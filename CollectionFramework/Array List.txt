Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.

It is like an array, but there is no size limit.

We can add or remove elements anytime.

it is much more flexible than the traditional array.

It is found in the java.util package.

The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also.

It implements the List interface so we can use all the methods 
of the List interface here.

The important points about the Java ArrayList class are:
1) Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
2) Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
3) Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
4) Java ArrayList allows random access because the array 
   works on an index basis.
5) In ArrayList, manipulation is a little bit slower
6) We can not create an array list of the primitive types,
   such as int, float, char, etc.It is required to use the
   required wrapper class in such cases.
   E.g:-
   ArrayList<int> al = ArrayList<int>(); // does not work  
   ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // works fine 
7) Java ArrayList gets initialized by the size. The size is 
   dynamic in the array list, which varies according to the 
   elements getting added or removed from the list.
