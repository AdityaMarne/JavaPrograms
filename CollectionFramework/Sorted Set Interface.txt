SortedSet is the alternate of Set interface that provides 
a total ordering on its elements.

The elements of the SortedSet are arranged in the increasing
(ascending) order. The SortedSet provides the additional methods 
 that inhibit the natural ordering of the elements.
 
 The SortedSet can be instantiated as:
 SortedSet<data-type> set=new TreeSet();
