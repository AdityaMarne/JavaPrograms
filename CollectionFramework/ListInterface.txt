List interface is the child interface of collection interface.

It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList,
Vector and Stack.

To instantiate the List interface, we must use :-
List<data-type> list1=new ArrayList();
List<data-type> list1=new LinkedList();
List<data-type> list1=new Vector();
List<data-type> list1=new Stack();

There are various methods in List interface that can be used to insert,
delete, and access the elements from the list.
