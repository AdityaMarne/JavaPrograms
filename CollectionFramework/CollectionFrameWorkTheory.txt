The collection in java is framework that provides an architecture
to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collection achieve all the operations that perform on a data 
such as searching, sorting, insertion, deletion.

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces(set, list, queue,
deque) and classes(ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, 
Hashset, LinkedHashSet, Treeset).

The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for 
the collection framework.

Collection has three types:
1)List :- ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
2)Queue :- PriorityQueue, Deque.
3)Set :- HashSet, LinkedHashSet, SortedSet, TreeSet

Methods of Collection interface

1)public boolean add(E e) :- It is used to insert an element in this collection.
2)public  boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E>c) :- It is used to insert the specified 
							collection elements in the invoking collection.
3)public boolean remove(Object element) :- It is used to deleye an element from the collection.
4)public boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c) :- It is used to delete all the elements of the 
							specified collection from the invoked collection.
5)default boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter) :- It is used to delete all the elements 
							of the collection that satisfy the specified predicate.
6)public boolean retainAll(Collection<?>c) :- It is used to delete all the elements of invoking 
							collection except the specified collection.
7)public int size() :- It returns the total number of elements in the collection.
8)public void clean() :- It removes the total number of elements from the collection.
9)public boolean contains(Object element) :- It is used to search an element.
10)public boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c) :- It is used to search the specified collection
							in the collection.
11)public Iterator iterator() :- It returns an iterator.
12)public Object[] toArray() :- It converts collection into array.
13)public boolean isEmpty() :- It checks if collection is empty.
14)public boolean equals(Object element) :- It matches two collections.
