Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package.

It represents the unordered set of elements whic doesn't allow
us to store the duplicate items.

We can store at most one null value in Set.

 Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
 
 Set can be instantiated as:
 
1) Set<data-type> s1=new HashSet<data-type>();
2) Set<data-type> s2=new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();
3) Set<date-type> s3=new TreeSet<data-type>();
