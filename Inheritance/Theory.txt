Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object 
acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also
known as a parent-child relationship.

Use of inheritance 
1] For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
2] For Code Reusability.

Syntax
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that
derives from an existing class.

Types of inheritance
1] Single
2] Multilevel
3] Hierarchical
4] Multiple (is not supported in java.)
Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. 
The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes
have the same method and you call it from child class object,
there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.
5] Hybrid
