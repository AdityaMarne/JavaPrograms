If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a static
variable.

1] The static variable can be used to refer to the common 
   property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), 
   for example, the company name of employees, college name of
   students, etc.
2] The static variable gets memory only once in the class area
   at the time of class loading.
