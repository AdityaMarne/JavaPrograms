In OOP technique, design a program using objects and classes.

Object in java is the physical as well as a logical entity, where
a class in java is a logical entity only.

1] What is an object in java
Ans :- An entity that as state and behavior is known as an object eg. chair,
	   bike, marker, pen etc. It can be physical or logical.
	   A Object 
	   
	   An object has three characteristics.
	   a]state : represnts the data(value) of an object.
	   b]behavior : represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such 
	                 as deposit, withdraw, etc.
	   c]identity : An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.
	                The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.
	                
Example :- pen is an object. Its name is reynolds, color is white know as its state.
		   It is used to write so writing is its behavior.
		   
		   
2] What is a class in Java
Ans :- A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a logical 
	   entity. It can't be physical.
	   
	   A class in java contains
	   a]Fields
	   b]Methods
	   c]Constructor
	   d]Blocks
	   e]Nested class and interface
	   
	   Syntax :-
	   class class_name{
	   	fields;
	   	methods;
	   }
	   
	   
3] Ways to initialize objects
Ans :- There are 3 ways to initialize object in java
	   1]By reference variable
	   2]By method
	   3]By constructor
