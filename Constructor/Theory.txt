a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.

It is called when an instance of the class is created.

It is a special type of method which is used to initialize
the object.

Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at
least one constructor is called.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor
available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides
a default constructor by default.

Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values
      at the time of object creation.

Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor.
 	  It controls the object creation. In other words, we can
 	  have private, protected, public or default constructor in Java.

Rules for creating Java Constructor
1]Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
2]A Constructor must have no explicit return type.
3]A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final,
  and synchronized
  

Types of Constructors
1]Default constructor(no-arg constructor)
2]Parameterized constructor
